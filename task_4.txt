My best project is A Website for a TV Series : "FRIENDS" which I have made during my 
internship at Technical Coding Research (TCR) Innovation where I have worked as Frontend
Web Developer Intern.

Basic idea: 
This project is all about the Tv series: FRIENDS which is the most popular series among 
people. I got an idea to create this project to make people aware about the cast worked 
in the series and also to advertise the series among youth because this series has 6 young 
people who are and struggling to survive in the real world, find the companionship, comfort
and support they get from each other to be the perfect antidote to the pressures of life. 

Modules Description: 
There is a home page created to view the trailer and live streaming of the series. This page
is a basic introduction of the series. At the bottom I have created one overview where the
links of Netflix and rating is given. It gives an idea to the people about the popularity
of the series. 
The next page is the about page of the cast who have worked in the series. Every cast details
is mentioned in about page which is linked to the home page at the bottom.
In the next page there is more information about the series is added and link to watch the
best episodes is linked with the image so that people can click on the image to directly
watch the episodes. 
At last one voucher page also made so that people can sign in and get the code to watch the
series at discount offer given in voucher.
At the bottom all the official social media handles are given for more information.

Technologies and platform used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code.
